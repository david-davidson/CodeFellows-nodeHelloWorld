A &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; Server in Node
==============================

This Node server runs on localhost:9001 and, for all variations on that URL, reads and writes &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; from a plain-text file.

Give it a try: clone the repo, `cd` into it, run `node index.js` to fire up the server, and visit `localhost:9001` (= `http://127.0.0.1:9001/`) in your favorite browser.
